#PoEDiscordBot

PoE Discord Bot is a bot which is a rewrite of PoEWikiBot in the python language.
Since the bot maintainer appears to be inactive, and I have a new idea for some bot functionality, I have decided to create this bot.

### Features

* Wiki Item retrieval (.get)
* poe.ninja pricecheck (.pc)

### Requirements

* python 3.6
* discord-python
* Selenium
* Pillow
* Chrome + Chromedriver

### Installation

    
    sudo pip install selenium
    sudo pip install discord.py
    sudo pip install Pillow
    
For chromedriver: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/

You must save the path where you store the chromedriver in config.py
